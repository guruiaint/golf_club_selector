This app is used for determining the golf club in your bag that you should use based on your range to the pin after correcting for the elevation change between you and the green, and the wind conditions.  The keys in the dictionary are set to my current yardages for the purpose of testing.  All you need to do is run the program in a Python shell and follow the prompts.  Use negative integers for downhill shots and downwind shots.  If you follow the prompts correctly you will be given a corrected yardage and a recommendation for which club to use.  Currently this app works for full swings with all of the clubs in the bag except for the putter, for obvious reasons, but can be expanded to include choke ups, half swings, 75% swings etc.
